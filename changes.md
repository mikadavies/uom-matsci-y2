## MATS23101 - Mechanics of Materials
### 07102021.2302 - Increased tensor flexibility
 - Tensors can now theoretically be of the 52nd rank/order (although such a tensor, with a maximum index of 3 would have over 6 septillion components)
 - Default tensor is a 2nd order 3x3 tensor of 0s
 - Tensors are still limited to have all indices of equal length, i.e. if *i=1,2,3*, *j=1,2,3*, *k=1,2,3*, etc...
