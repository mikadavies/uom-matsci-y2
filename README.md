# uom-matsci-y2

## Work In Progress

A repository for code representing the computational aspect of modules covered in the 2nd year of materials science and engineering at the university of Manchester.

Units covered currently are:
 - MATS23101 Mechanics of Materials

This repository has only just been started and currently has very little content. Topics covered are:
 - Basic tensor operations

Although this repository was mainly created as a means of revision and workload reduction, feel free to use it for other reasons.

*A Julia fork of the tensor script is currently being developped*
